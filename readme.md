# GA SEI Project 2 - FanList

FanList is a web application created for Project 2 of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. The aim of the project was to create a web application with Mongoose, Express and Handlebars.

FanList is conceptualized as a site that lists users according to the fandoms that they are in and fandoms according to the users that are in them. The idea is to be able to find fellow fans.

Due to the time restraints of the project, the web application at the time of writing is only set up for basic functionality and does not employ an authentication/authorization system. The project board listed below shows various ideas for building out the site that have not yet been executed.
